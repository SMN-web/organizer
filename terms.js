    <h3>Terms & Conditions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Purpose of the App</strong><br>
        This app is designed for friends or small groups to register shared expenses and follow up balances. It is only a record-keeping tool and does not handle real money transfers.
      </li>
      <li><strong>How It Works</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Users can add expenses, assign them to group members, and view balances.</li>
          <li>Entries you add in a group may be visible to other members of that group.</li>
          <li>The app only shows calculated balances. Settlements must be handled directly between friends.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Data & Privacy</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>We use Firebase Authentication for sign-in and cloudflare D1 database for data storage.</li>
          <li>Some requests are processed through Cloudflare Workers for speed and security.</li>
          <li>We do not sell, trade, or share your data with third parties.</li>
          <li>While we use secure platforms, no system is 100% risk-free.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Responsibilities</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>You are responsible for the expenses and data you enter.</li>
          <li>Disagreements or settlements between friends are outside the appâ€™s responsibility.</li>
          <li>The app is only a tool to help track; it does not verify or enforce payments.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Limitations of Liability</strong><br>
        We are not responsible for:
        <ul>
          <li>Any financial losses, errors, or disputes between friends.</li>
          <li>Downtime, calculation errors, or delays in data updates.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Updates</strong><br>
        We may update these Terms when needed. Continued use of the app means you accept the latest version.
      </li>
